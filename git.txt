Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

    Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
    Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
    Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
    "Push" your changes to your main branch
    Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
    "Pull" the changes to your local machine
    Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
    Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
    "Merge" your branch to the main branch


1. git config --global user.name <name> 
		Define the author name to be used for all commits by the current user.

2. git config --global user.email <email> 
		Define the author email to be used for all commits by the current user

3. git init <directory>
		Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments to initialize the current 
         directory as a git repository.

4. git clone <repo> 
        clone repo located in github to the current directory.

5. git add <fileslist>/.

6. git commit -m "commit Message"

7. git branch -M <branchname> 
   ex: git branch -M main

8. git remote add <name> <url>  -- <name> can be used as shortcut for the url
   git remote add origin https://github.com/praveeniiht/dummyrepo.git
  

9. git push -u origin main

10. git log --

11. git branch  -- List all of the branches in your repo

12. git checkout -b <branch>

    This command will create a new branch called <branch> and checksout the code intoit.
    if we remove -b then it will looks for existing branch to checkout

13. git merge <branch>
     Merge <branch> into the current branch.
